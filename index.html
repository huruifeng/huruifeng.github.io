                        I am currently a Senior Research Associate in Computational Biology/Bioinformatics, working in the lab of Dr. Xianjun Dong 
                            and Dr. Clemnes Scherzer at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. 
                            My research is focusing on the application of multivariate statistics, machine learning, and deep learning to mics data, and bioinformatics data, in general.

                        <p>
                        My research is to develop methods to unveil the hidden biological circuitries underlying the data, from
                        understanding sequence-based regulations to the genomes or epigenomes and their impacts on diseases, to drug
                        development using advanced models with the focuses on precision medicine, drug repurposing, immunotherapy,
                        et.al including (i) Decoding genomic sequence to decipher connections between sequence, functions, and
                        phenotypes, especially leveraging sequence data and deep learning models (e.g.:Predict eQTLs, mutations effects);
                        (ii) Using AI and machine learning to analyze large amounts of data and predict the effectiveness and safety of
                        drugs (e.g.:Impute drug responses); (iii) Investigate the strategies to stimulate the immune system to fight cancer
                        cells and other diseases (e.g.: Modeling HLA epitopes, HLA-peptide binding prediction, T-cell response); (iv)
                        Developing data integration techniques, constructing databases, and creating webserver platforms to facilitate
                        access to research findings; (v) Multi-omics data analysis and a variety of bioinformatics statistical modeling.
                        Ultimately, my goal is to contribute to the development of new drugs that can improve patient outcomes and
                        alleviate human suffering.
